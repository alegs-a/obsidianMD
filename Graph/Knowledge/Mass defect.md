# Mass defect
The mass defect of an atom's nucleus is the difference between the its atomic mass and the sum of the masses of its [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]. This difference is equivalent to the energy released when forming the nucleus using [[Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation]], which is equal to the [[Binding Energy]] of the nucleus.

## Calculation
To calculate the mass defect of a nucleus, subtract the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons from its atomic mass. This is equal to:
$$ Mass\ defect = atomic\ mass - (no.\ of\ protons \times mass\ of\ proton) + (no.\ of\ neutrons \times mass\ of\ neutron)$$
