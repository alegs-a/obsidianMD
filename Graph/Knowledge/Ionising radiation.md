# Ionising radiation
Ionising radiation is a particle or type of energy that can cause electrons to be removed from an atom it interacts with, thereby leaving it charged. It can be caused by the decaying of unstable nuclei.

## Types of ionising radiation
### Alpha particles
An alpha particle is another name for a helium nucleus, or a particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons. This means that they are strongly positively charged, and will remove two electrons from atoms they come into contact with, leaving those atoms ionised.
