# Matrices

## Definition

A matrix is a two-dimensional array which stores elements and their relative positions

## Notation

Matrices are usually denoted with a capital letter, e.g.

$$A=\left[\begin{matrix}1\\2\end{matrix}\right]$$

We refer to the individual elements using the following notation:

$$A_{m\times n}=\left[\begin{matrix}a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} & \ldots \\ a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3} & \ldots \\ a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3} & \ldots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots\end{matrix}\right]$$

where $a$ refers to an element of $A$.

Matrix $A$ has dimensions of $m\times n$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.

Note that rows and columns are reversed with respect to the Cartesian plane - in matrices, rows are written before columns.

Two matrices are equal if and only if every single element is equal and in the same place in both, or 

$$a_{m,n} = b_{m,n}, \forall m, n \in \Bbb{N}$$

This means that for two matrices to be equal their dimensions must be identical.
