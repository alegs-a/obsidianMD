# Momentum
Inertia an object has while in motion proportional to its speed and mass, in the direction of its [[Velocity|velocity]].

Momentum is a vector quantity, since it is defined in terms of an object's _velocity_ rather than its _speed_.

The momentum $p$ of an object is given by 
$$p=mv$$
which means that $p$ has the units $\textnormal{kgms}^{-1}$ $\left(\frac{kgm}{s}\right)$.

## Conservation of momentum
The total momentum of a system does not change after a collision.
