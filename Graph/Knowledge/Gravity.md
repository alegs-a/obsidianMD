A gravitational field is a [[Vectors|vector]] [[Fields (physics)|field]]. They define the [[Acceleration (stub)|acceleration]] due to gravity that an object will experience, i.e. acceleration due to gravity is actually the strength of the gravitational field in that location.

By definition, gravitational field strength only depends on the [[Distance (physics)]] from a given object $r$.

## Gravitational acceleration $g$

Outside the planet's surface, the gravitational field strength is given by 
$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
where
- $g$ is the strength of the gravitational field, in $ms^{-1}$ or $Nkg^{-1}$
- $G$ is the gravitational constant $6.67\times 10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$
- $M$ is the [[Mass]] of the planet
- $r$ is the [[Distance (physics)]] from the centre of the planet

## Newton's universal law of gravitation
Combining gravitational field strength and [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Newton's Second Law|Newton's Second Law]], we get:
$$ F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
where
- $m$ is the mass of the less massive object
- $M$ is the mass of the more massive object

This [[Force]] always exists as a straight line between the centre of mass of both objects.

Newton's third law applies here too - the basketball I throw up is exerting force on the Earth, just it is too small to be noticeable due to the huge difference in the masses of the objects.
