# Roots of a complex number

The roots of a [[Complex Numbers|complex number]] are found using [[De Moivre's Theorem]] by raising a complex number to a fractional power of the form $z^\frac 1a, a \in \Bbb N$, equivalent to $\sqrt[a]{z}$.  $\newcommand{\cis}{\operatorname{cis}}$

The complex number $z = a+bi$ should be expressed in polar form $z = r \cis\theta$.
