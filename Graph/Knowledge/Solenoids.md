# Solenoids

A solenoid is a single long wire that is wrapped into the shape of a cylinder. When a current is run through the wire, the interaction of the [[Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] from each turn of the wire create a net magnetic field from one end of the solenoid to another.

The direction of this magnetic field can be determined using the right-hand rule, where your fingers wrap in the direction of the current and your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field.

## Magnetic field strength

The strength of the magnetic field from a current-carrying wire is

$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r} $$

where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant (in QCAA data book), $I$ is the current in the wire and $2\pi r$ is the

## Magnetic field strength in a solenoid

The magnetic field strength inside a solenoid is given by the formula

$$B = \mu_0nI$$

where $B$ is the magnetic field strength, $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant, $n$ is the number of loops of wire *per metre* and $I$ is the current in the wire.
