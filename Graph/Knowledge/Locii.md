# Locii
A locus is a set of points in the complex plane that satisfy a condition. For example, a line can be defined as the set of points that are equidistant from two [[Complex Numbers]], and a circle can be defined as the set of points that are the same distance from a single complex number. 

## Locus definition of a circle
A circle is defined as the set of points that are equidistant from a point. For example, $|z|=1$ defines [[The unit circle]] on the complex plane, since it is the set of all points that are exactly 1 unit away from the origin. More generally, $|z|=r$ defines a circle with radius $r$ centered at the origin. Similarly, $\lt$ $\leq$ $\gt$ and $\geq$ can be used to define the set of points that are inside or outside the circle, including or excluding the boundary.

Circles can also be translated on the plane. These will be of the form $|z-(a+bi)| = r$, where $a+bi$ is the new center of the circle. 

## Locus definition of a line
A line is defined by the set of points that are equidistant from two complex numbers. This means that the line will be the perpendicular bisector of the two points. 

A line is defined as $|z-(a_1+b_1i)| = |z-(a_2+b_2i)|$, where $a_1+b_1i$ and $a_2+b_2i$ are the two points which the line perpendicularly bisects.
