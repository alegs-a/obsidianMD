# Binding energy
The binding energy of a nucleus is its [[Mass defect]] multiplied by $c^2$ as per [[Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation|Einstein's equation]]. This energy is equivalent to the energy released when the nucleus was formed, or, if it is negative, the energy required for fusion to occur to form the nucleus. 

Binding energy is often measured in mega[[electron volts]], which is a simple conversion from the [[Joules]] found using $E=mc^2$.
