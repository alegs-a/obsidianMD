# Maximum and minimum speed

For a given position vector

$$ \vec s(t) = f(t)\hat i + g(t)\hat j $$

its velocity is

$$ \vec v(t) = f'(t)\hat i + g'(t)\hat j $$

Its speed is thus

$$ b(t) = \sqrt{(f'(t))^2+(g'(t)^2)} $$

Since $b$ is now a regular function of $t$, we can simply find $bâ€™(t)=0$ and
