# Vector dot product
The vector dot product of two [[Vectors]] $a$ and $b$ is a scalar quantity equal to either
$$ a\cdot b = x_ax_b + y_ay_b + z_az_b $$
where $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the horizontal, vertical and perpendicular components of the two vectors, or
$$ a\cdot b = |a||b|\cos\theta $$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. 

This means that the dot product of two vectors that are perpendicular is zero, since $\cos(\frac\pi 2) = 0$.
