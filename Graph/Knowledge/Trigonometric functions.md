# Trigonometric functions
$\sin x$, $\cos x$, $\tan x$

## $\sin$
The sine [[Functions|function]] is the length of the perpendicular through a point $x$ [[Radians]] around the [[The unit circle|unit circle]].

## Inverse of sine, cosine and tangent
The inverse (reflection around $y=x$) of the function $f(x) = \sin x$ is not valid, and likewise for $\cos x$ and $\tan x$. Instead, we define inverse functions with a limited domain and range, so that they always produce only one result (as per the definition of a function).

These functions are $\arcsin x$, $\arccos x$ and $\arctan x$.

These functions have limited domains, of $[-1:1]$, and have ranges:

$$ \arcsin x: \left[\frac{-\pi}{2} : \frac\pi 2\right] $$
