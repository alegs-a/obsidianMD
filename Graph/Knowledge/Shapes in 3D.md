# Spheres

The equation of a circle in the Cartesian plane is

$$ (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 = r^2 $$

In three dimensions, the equation of a circle is

$$ (x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2 $$

```ad-question
Types of question:
- here is a sphere in expanded form, complete the square on x, y and z terms
- here are two points $a$ and $b$, find the sphere such that $\bar{ab}$ is a diameter
	- find midpoint, radius
```

# Lines

A line is defined by a point which lies on it and a direction [[Vectors|vector]] $\vec d$ which is parallel to the line, expressed as:

$$ \left[\begin{array} xx \\ y \\ z \end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array} xx_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{array}\right] + \lambda \vec d$$

where $\lambda$ is any scalar.

## Finding a line from points

For any given points $A$ and $B$, find the vector between them $\vec{AB}$ and express the line as

$$ P = A + \lambda \vec{AB} $$
```ad-question
- find the points that make a line with the vector $\vec d$
	- This is done by writing the vector equation of the line as a [[Matrices|matrix]] sum and finding the $\lambda$ that makes the equation true, 
```

The property of lines in 2D that they will always intersect an axis unless they are parallel does not exist in 3D, instead they will intersect planes.

## Intersection of lines
If two linesâ€™ direction vectors are not parallel,
