# Complex numbers
A complex number has real and imaginary components, which in combination define a point on the complex plane. The complex plane's horizontal axis is real, and its vertical axis is purely imaginary, where the imaginary number $i$ is defined as
$$ i^2 = -1 $$
and by definition
$$ \sqrt{-1} = i $$

This means that a complex number can be expressed in the form $a+bi$, where $a$ is the real constant and $b$ is the coefficient of the imaginary term, defining the complex equivalent of the Cartesian point $(a, b)$.

A complex number can also be expressed in polar form, as a magnitude and an angle measured anti-clockwise from right horizontal. However,^[due to the QCAAâ€™s idiocy] we will only express this polar form as abbreviated Cartesian form, of the form
$$ \cis a+bi = r\cis\theta $$
where $r$ is a scalar multiple and $\cis\theta$ is an abbreviaiton of $(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$, meaning that the final expanded form is 
$$ a+bi = r\cos\theta+r\sin\theta \ i $$

The [[Sets|set]] of complex numbers is denoted $\Bbb C$.
