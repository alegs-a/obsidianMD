# The morning show theme
> PERFORMANCE: In the drama series, "Morning Wars", viewers experience a TV morning show production team at work. There lives are fast-paced and the stress level is relentless. Using the performance elements of your choice, how is this atmosphere expressed in the music? Use timecode to justify your assertions.

The performance of The Morning Show's theme contributes nothing to the rushed and stressed atmosphere of the work. The vocalist takes great liberty in their phrasing and tempo (0:34) which adds nothing to the stressful atmosphere, which is instead created through the fast semiquavers in the accompaniment. The vocalist also uses small *portamenti* (0:41) to individualise their performance and add interest and variety to the phrase, which again contributes precisely nothing to the fast-paced atmosphere the work is depicting. The dynamic of the work *crescendos* throughout, but this is a compositional device. The work uses increasingly complex rhythmic devices throughout, but this is a compositional device. The work uses a driving and just barely restrained ostinato, but again, this is a compositional device. The performance choices made by the performers have contributed nothing to the rushed and stressful mood of the work.
