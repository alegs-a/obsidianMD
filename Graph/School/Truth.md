# Truth
## Definition

The opposite of a lie, something which can be proven

If a claim has no tangible evidence, how can it be proven (as per definition) to be true? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, so only past events which left tangible evidence that remains today which exclusively was left by that event can be truthfully declared as having happened.
