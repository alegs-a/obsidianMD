# Student experiment

## Rationale
- Original experiment
	- Summarise
	- Key findings (We did … and found …)
	- Limitations and uncertainties
		- Justify why a new experiment should be done
- Theory
	- Explain limitaitons of previous experiment
		- Links to design of new experiment
	- Predict new results (in general terms, e.g. $F\propto I$)
	- Specific to previous or new expeirment
- Diagrams and data
	- Only if needed to explain a point
- Paragraphs
	- One paragraph for every point you make. If a sentence isn’t directly related to the previous one, it needs a new paragraph
