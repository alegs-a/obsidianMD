# Magnets

A magnet is a material or object that produces a [[magnetic field]]. There are two types of magnets, permanent magnets and electromagnets.

## Permanent magnets

A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetised and has a persistent magnetic field.

## Electromagnets

An electromagnet is a magnet whose strength and polarity is dependent on the amount and direction of current flowing through a wire or wires. [[Solenoids]] are an example of a type of electromagnet.
