# Alex's obsidian vault

This is an amalgamation of all of the things I have learnt since I started using Obsidian, and some of the things I learnt before that.

You are welcome to use it for personal use, but if you use the vault as a whole please credit this repo. This project is distributed under the MIT licence.
