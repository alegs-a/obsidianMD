# Thinking on Unit 1 + 2 exams
### Unit 1
CF skills from unit 1:
- [[vectors]]
	- [[vector dot product|dot product]]
- 

One CF skill I nailed: [[Proof]]?
One CF skill I've forgotten (well, I didn't really know it to begin with): [[Forces on the inclined plane]]

# Everything I messed up
### Unit 1
- [[Intersecting tangents theorem]]
- [[Permutations]]
- [[Forces on the inclined plane]]

### Unit 2
- [[Rational functions]]
- Proofs using [[Inverse trigonometric functions|inverse trig functions]]
- Rotation around a point other than the origin (transformation matrices)
- 

# VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO
- [x] [[Rational functions]]
- [x] [[Roots of a complex number]]
- [x] [[Gaussian elimination]]
- [ ] [[Induction]]
- [x] [[Locii]]

# Things to look at
- [[Inverse trigonometric functions]]
- [[absolute value functions]]
- [[Matrix transformations|transformation matrices]], especially rotations
- Angle between two [[vectors]]
