## Brainstorming
### Data privacy
- affects everybody
- you don't own your data
- future impacts:
	- government overreach
	- company honesty
	- 
- perspective: you should take more ownership of your data
	- turn off location services
	- use privacy-oriented browsers
	- educate yourself about how to increase the security and anonymity of your data

### No such thing as a free lunch
We live under the tyrannical reign of capitalism. That means that almost everything anybody ever does is motivated, at some level, by profit. So how, then, does anything free exist, even something as simple as making a Google search - how can Google make a profit from you typing 'how to get good atar' into a search bar? They aren't selling you a product, and they certainly aren't spending huge amounts of money on optimising their search engine out of the goodness of their hearts.

The answer to this is that _you_ are the product. Google harvests every single piece of data that they possibly can from you, all the time. Who leaves location services on on their phone? If you do, that means that there's a database somewhere that can tell anyone with access to it where you live, who you live with, who is in your english class, and what shops you went into on the weekend, and bear in mind - location data is just one of the huge number of data points that are harvested by big tech companies from you all the time. 

Images that you upload to Facebook or Instagram. Files you save to iCloud or Google Drive. Messages you send on Instagram, WhatsApp, or anywhere else, even if they promise end-to-end encryption, unless they advertise user-held encryption keys are inherently not secure. 

A brief run-down of encryption: encryption is a process by which data is scrambled so that unless you have the password, or key, to decrypt it, it is gibberish to anyone else who tries to read it. This is why _user-held keys_ are so important - if Facebook holds the encryption keys to your "encrypted" WhatsApp messages, then they're not really encrypted, since Facebook can give anybody they like access to your data, even if they've pinky promised you that it's encrypted and secure.

This creates yet another issue - if the private companies that own all of your data have access to it, then there is absolutely nothing stopping them from distributing that data to whoever they like. Usually this constitutes selling your data to other companies to allow them to target you with ads relating to your browsing history, or the shops you visited recently, or even the browsing history of the people you live with, but in more nefarious cases it can be provided to governments or law enforcement without your knowledge. Privacy of correspondence is specifically protected in Article 12 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights - how have we allowed a 

Government subpoenas of user data are possible given private companies have access to it.



## Take 2
McDonald's. The classic first job for the teenager just wanting to earn a bit of extra money while they're at school - most people in this room probably know someone who's worked at Maccas at some stage. 
Who here knows someone who works at McDonald's? What would you say if I told you that thousands of McDonald's workers at more than 110 locations across Australia may have been cheated out of the breaks that their employer is legally required to provide? This is part of a growing trend in workplaces around the world of workers being treated unfairly or inhumanely which may become an increasing problem in the future as our generation enters the workforce. I'm Alex, and I care about worker's rights, since just like all of you I'm going to be entering the workforce in a few years, and I believe in a workforce which is able to stand up for itself against the huge corporations which employ 84% of the population [1]. Here's an example of what I mean.

Under the Fast Food Industry Award, workers are entitled to a 10-minute paid break for four hours of work, and another 10-minute break for nine hours of work. In an ongoing court case, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the SDA, alleges that some McDonald's franchises told workers they would receive a free soft drink instead of a break, and that others were told they didn't receive breaks because they were allowed to have a drink and go to the toilet whenever they wanted. This is blatantly against what McDonald's is required to provide, not to mention highly unethical, and yet nobody took action until the SDA did. But who is the SDA?

There's a word that I've avoided using so far, because in recent times governments and lobbyists have very successfully stigmatised it and undermined the power of the organisations that it describes: unions. Historically, unions have been incredibly powerful groups that have made massive improvements to working conditions, pay rates, leave requirements and justice for workers. Paid sick leave, paid annual leave, maternity leave, even the simple existence of a minimum wage and the five day work week - these are all things we take for granted, but which were first introduced as a result of union action. It goes without saying, though, that large corporations would much rather being able to work employees to the bone in inhospitable environments since that would increase their profit margin, so they have continually lobbied governments to introduce laws that reduce the power of unions. 

Now back to the McDonald's story. Workers were deprived en masse of their legal rights, but if any one employee complained to management about the lack of breaks they would at best be told to suck it up, and at worst fired. Instead, what the employees needed was a group to represent *everyone* who had been unfairly treated: a union. This union, the SDA, was able to force McDonald's to take their complaint seriously and, depending on the outcome of the legal action, pay compensation to the workers who were affected.

This is a prime example of how unions can act to help workers who have been treated unfairly, injured, or discriminated against at work. But there are other benefits that unions bring to the workforce - they will actively campaign to improve working conditions, such as the campaign happening right now to get 100% pay for 18 year olds.

Currently, 18 and 19 year olds get paid up to 30% less than 20 year olds **for the same job**, simply because of their age. That's you earning 70 dollars for every 100 that a 20 year old makes. Everyone in this room is 18 or will be soon, and I think you'll agree with me that there's no reason we should make 30% less than someone a mere two years older than us. Fortunately, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (the ACTU) is campaigning to get 18 year olds the pay that we deserve, and the best part is that you can be a part of this movement: go to 100percentpay.com.au to learn more. In fact, this campaign is an ongoing one and has already successfully won 20 year olds the right to equal pay; originally 21 was the age at which you earned full wages. This is the beauty of a unionised workforce: it can act to improve working conditions for *everyone*.

So once you've found a stable job, or moved into a trade, google the union for your industry and see what benefits it offers for you - common ones include free legal services if your employer acts illegally, like firing you unfairly, negotiation on your behalf for better pay rates, and teams to offer legal advice if you are injured at work. Think of it like an insurance company, except as well as protecting you if things go wrong, it actively works to improve your life. So join your union if you can, but most importantly make sure that you know your rights and are informed at work, so that you can join the fight for a better future.

Thank you.
