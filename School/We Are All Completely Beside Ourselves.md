Why is it called We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves?

Hale-Bopp is a recurring thing

Rosemary is the most relatable first-person narrator I have come across—that’s not necessarily saying a lot though

Rosemary’s father reflects Karen Joy Fowler’s a lot: spends time fly-fishing, is obsessed with mathematical ideas (p. 18)

# Truth

## Memory

This could be an interesting idea for an article based on [[truth]]

Rosemary discusses the fickleness of memory at multiple points throughout the book; how we can reconstruct our memories without noticing and then be incredibly confident that memory we now remember is the one true original, meaning that all long-term memories must be treated with a degree of caution, since we cannot determine whether they have been altered or not.

### The cat

Rosemary tells the story of her dad running over a cat which refused to get out of the way of the car. She says that she is absolutely certain this happened:

> To this day, I can feel the bump of the tire over the cat’s body (p. 91)

and simultaneously is certain that it didn’t:

> And to this day I am certain in my mind that it never happened. Think of it as my own personal Schrödinger’s cat. (p. 91)

Grandma Donna also reassures her that her father would never do such a thing, despite her apparently taking any opportunity to find the worst in Rosemary’s father. Rosemary herself also rationalises the fact that he couldn’t have run over the cat:

> He would never run over a cat unless there was something to be learned by doing so.

Does this mean that her memory is accurate, and he was conducting an experiment, even one conceived mere moments before, or was the memory fabricated and he didn’t ever run over a cat?

 Eng ia1 bits

Both Rosemary and Olive have parents who hide an addiction from one another (Olive’s mum: smoking, Rosemary’s dad: drinking). Links to [[truth]]—lack of honesty between parents creates a strained dynamic. Rosemary says as much:

> Instead he’d become a secret drinker. It kept mom on high alert […] (p. 18)
