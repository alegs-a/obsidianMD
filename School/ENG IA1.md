## Brainstorming
### Data privacy
- affects everybody
- you don't own your data
- future impacts:
	- government overreach
	- company honesty
	- 
- perspective: you should take more ownership of your data
	- turn off location services
	- use privacy-oriented browsers
	- educate yourself about how to increase the security and anonymity of your data

# Script
### No such thing as a free lunch
We live under the tyrannical reign of capitalism. That means that almost everything anybody ever does is motivated, at some level, by profit. So how, then, does anything free exist, even something as simple as making a Google search - how can Google make a profit from you typing 'how to get good atar' into a search bar? They aren't selling you a product, and they certainly aren't spending huge amounts of money on optimising their search engine out of the goodness of their hearts.

The answer to this is that _you_ are the product. Google harvests every single piece of data that they possibly can from you, all the time. Who leaves location services on on their phone? If you do, that means that there's a database somewhere that can tell anyone with access to it where you live, who you live with, who is in your english class, and what shops you went into on the weekend, and bear in mind - location data is just one of the huge number of data points that are harvested by big tech companies from you all the time. 

Images that you upload to Facebook or Instagram. Files you save to iCloud or Google Drive. Messages you send on Instagram, WhatsApp, or anywhere else, even if they promise end-to-end encryption, unless they advertise user-held encryption keys are inherently not secure. 

A brief run-down of encryption: encryption is a process by which data is scrambled so that unless you have the password, or key, to decrypt it, it is gibberish to anyone else who tries to read it. This is why _user-held keys_ are so important - if Facebook holds the encryption keys to your "encrypted" WhatsApp messages, then they're not really encrypted, since Facebook can give anybody they like access to your data, even if they've pinky promised you that it's encrypted and secure.

This creates yet another issue - if the private companies that own all of your data have access to it, then there is absolutely nothing stopping them from distributing that data to whoever they like. Usually this constitutes selling your data to other companies to allow them to target you with ads relating to your browsing history, or the shops you visited recently, or even the browsing history of the people you live with, but in more nefarious cases it can be provided to governments or law enforcement without your knowledge. Privacy of correspondence is specifically protected in Article 12 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights - how have we allowed a 

Government subpoenas of user data is possible given private companies have access to it.
