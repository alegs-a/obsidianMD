# Vector cross product

The vector cross product is a [[Vectors|vector]] operation expressed as $\vec u\times \vec v$ which returns a vector with three properties:

1. It is mutually perpendicular to $\vec u$ and $\vec v$
2. It is mutually anticlockwise from $\vec u \rightarrow \vec v \rightarrow \vec u \times \vec v$
3. $|u\times v|$ is the area of the parallelogram with sides of $\vec u$ and $\vec v$. This means that this magnitude is equal to $|u||v|\sin\theta$, where $\sin\theta$ is the perpendicular height of the parallelogram, relative to the angle $\theta$ between $u$ and $v$.

Thus, the cross product of two vectors is equal to:

$$ \vec u \times \vec v = |\vec u||\vec v|\sin\theta \hat r$$

where $\hat r$ is the unit vector that satisfies conditions 1 and 2 above (is normal to the plane defined by $\vec u$ and $\vec v$).
