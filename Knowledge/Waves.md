# Waves
A wave consists of a periodic disturbance of some kind that propogates through space. A wave consists of a periodic disturbance of some kind that propogates through space. This propogation can occur in one of two ways:
- by the interaction of physical particles in matter (mechanical waves). This produces a transfer of energy without the net transfer of matter.
- by the movement of energy without the need for this energy to transfer between particles in matter.

## Transverse and longitudinal waves
A transverse wave involves the particle or particles being physically displaced perpendicular to the direction of the wave's travel. The motion of a rope being waggled exemplifies this.

A longitudinal wave instead involves periods of compression and rarefaction (decompression), where the motion of particles is parallel to the direction of propogation of the wave.

## Properties of waves
Let us define certain properties of a wave:
- Amplitude (no symbol, $\text m$): the maximum distance a particle is displaced from its mean position as the wave passes
- Speed ($v$, $\text{ms}^{-1}$): the rate at which the wave propogates through space
- Wavelength ($\lambda$, $\text m$): the distance between two peaks of the wave
- Frequency ($f$, $\text{Hz}$): the number of wavelengths that pass a point in one second 
- Period ($T$, $\text s$): The amount of time for one wavelength to pass through a point in space.

## The wave equation
These properties can be related using the wave equation, which states
$$ v = \lambda f $$


Since speed is also defined as
$$ v = \frac{d}{\Delta t} $$
in a wave this is
$$ v = \frac\lambda T $$
or the wavelength divided by the time taken for that wavelength.

We can also define the frequency as
$$ f=\frac 1T$$
since
$$ f = \frac{\text{cycles}}s $$
or the frequency in Hz is the number of wavelengths that fit into once second.

This also means that 
$$ T=\frac 1f$$ 

This means that:
$$ v = \frac\lambda T = \frac{\lambda}{\frac 1f} = \lambda f $$
