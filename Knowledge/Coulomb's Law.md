# Electrostatic force
The electrostatic force is the [[Force]] that exists between two charged objects as a result of their charge. The magnitude and direction of the force is dependent on the polarity and strength of the two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$.

The electrostatic force $F$ is:
$$ F = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2} $$
where
- $k$ is Coulomb's constant, equal to $\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}$ where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $8.8542 \cdot 10^{-12}\textnormal C^2 \textnormal N^{-1}$. $k$ is approximately equal to $9\cdot 10^9$
- $q_{1,2}$ are the two charges, in Coulombs
- $r$ is the distance between the two charges

This is known as Coulomb's Law.

## Electric field strength
The electric field strength is an electric field's ability to do apply force per Coulomb of charge.
