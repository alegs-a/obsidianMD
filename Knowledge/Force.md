# Force
A force is an influence that can change the motion of an object. This can be intuitively thought of as a push or a pull on the object.

Force is measured in Newtons, and has the base [[SI Units]] of $\text{Kg} \cdot \text{ms}^2$.

Forces are [[vectors]], since they have direction and magnitude. This means that they can be represented in polar or Cartesian forms, and as [[matrices]] or as horizontal and vertical components, as determined by the purpose for which the force is used.
