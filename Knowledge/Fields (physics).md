# What is a field?
A field is a quantity which we can define a value for at every single point in space. It can be either a [[Vectors|vector]] field or a [[Scalar (stub)|scalar]] field.

A scalar field has only magnitude (e.g. temperature was the example in class but it doesn't seem very good), whereas a vector field has magnitude and direction, such as [[Gravity|gravity]] or a magnetic field
