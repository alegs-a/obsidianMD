# Keplerâ€™s laws of planetary motion
## 1 - law of ellipses

The planets move in an elliptical orbit around the sun with the sun at one focus.

## 2 - law of equal areas

The line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time

The area subtended by the arc traversed in an amount of time is always equal

## 3 - law of harmony or law of period

For every planet, the ratio of the cube of the average orbital radius $r$ to the square of the period $T$ of revolution is the same for all planets orbiting a body

$$ \frac{r^3}{T^2} $$
