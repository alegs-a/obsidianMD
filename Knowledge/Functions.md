# Functions
A function is a binary relation between two [[Sets]] that associates each element of one set to exactly one element of the other set.

## Types of function
### Polynomial
A polynomial function is of the form
$$\begin{align}
f(x) & = \sum_{r=0}^n a_rx^r \\
f(x) & = a_0x^0+a_1x^1+a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n 
\end{align}$$
This consists only of multiples of $x$ raised to a positive integer power. In this example, $n$ is referred to as the _power_ or _degree_ of the polynomial.

By the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]], a polynomial of order $n$ has $n$ roots over the [[complex numbers]] $\Bbb C$.^[1 Note: QCAA Mathematical Methods does not acknowledge the existence of complex numbers, meaning that it says some functions have less than $n$ solutions.]

### Trigonometric functions
See [[Trigonometric functions]]

### Hyperbolic functions
A hyperbolic function is of the form 
$$ f(x) = \frac a{x-h} + k $$
meaning that the base form is 
$$ f(x) = \frac 1x $$

$a$ affects the vertical dilation of the graph, while $h$ and $k$ affect the horizontal and vertical translations respectively.
