# Acceleration

Acceleration is the second [[derivative]] of position with respect to time, and the first derivative of [[velocity]]. Acceleration is the rate of change of an object's velocity, and is measured in $\text{ms}^{-2}$.

Acceleration is a [[Vectors|vector]], since it has both direction (in what direction is the object accelerating) and magnitude (how fast is it accelerating in that direction). 

If an object has non-zero velocity, a [[force]] which acts exactly against its velocity is sometimes said to _decelerate_ the object. However, this is in fact just acceleration; deceleration is not a technically defined concept.
