# Induction
Mathematical induction is a method of proving mathematical theorems. In essence, it entails proving that if the theorem is true for some $n$, it is also true for $n+1$ (or $n+2$, $n+3$ as the case may be). Therefore, by proving the case $n=1$ (or $n=2$ etc) we have also proved $n=2\ldots \infty$, since each case of $n$ proves the one after it.

More formally, using proposition notation where $P(n)$ is a proposition that the theorem is true for some $n$: 
$P(n) \implies P(n+1)$
$P(1)$
$\therefore P(n), n \in \Z^+$
