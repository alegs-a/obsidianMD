# Vectors

A vector is a quantity that can be fully described by both a direction and a magnitude. Examples include:
- [[Velocity]]
- [[Acceleration (stub)]]

A vector can be either expressed in Cartesian form, as multiples of the unit vectors $\hat{i}$ and $j$, or in polar form, using a magnitude $r$ and a direction $\theta$.

## Representation as a matrix
A vector can be represented by a column [[Matrices|matrix]]

## Vector operations
### Addition and subtraction
To add vectors, convert to Cartesian form and add the horizontal and vertical components

### Scalar multiplication
Cartesian form: multiply the horizontal and vertical components by a scalar
Polar form: multiply the magnitude by a scalar

### Dot product
The dot product is an operation that produces
