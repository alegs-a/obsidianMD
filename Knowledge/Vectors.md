For vectors in three dimensions, see [[3D vectors]]

# Vectors

A vector is a quantity that can be fully described by both a direction and a magnitude. Examples include:

- [[Velocity]]
- [[Acceleration (stub)]]

A vector can be either expressed in Cartesian form, as multiples of the unit vectors $\hat{i}$ and $j$, or in polar form, using a magnitude $r$ and a direction $\theta$.

## Representation as a matrix

A vector can be represented by a column [[Matrices|matrix]]

## Vector operations

### Addition and subtraction

To add vectors, convert to Cartesian form and add the horizontal and vertical components

### Scalar multiplication

Cartesian form: multiply the horizontal and vertical components by a scalar

Polar form: multiply the magnitude by a scalar

### Dot product

The [[vector dot product]] is a vector operation which returns a scalar.

### Cross product
The [[Vector cross product]] is a vector operation which returns a vector perpendicular to its two inputs
