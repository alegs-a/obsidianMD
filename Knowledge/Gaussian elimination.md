# Gaussian elimination
Gaussian elimination is a technique for manipulating the elements of a system of simultaneous equations expressed in an augmented [[Matrices|matrix]] by adding or subtracting rows from scalar multiples of one another. This produces the possible row operations of:
- Scalar multiplication
	- Multiply each term by a scalar
	- $k\cdot R_n \to R_n$
- Row addition
	- Add the terms of one row to those of another
	- $R_n + R_m \to R_m$

Note that these
