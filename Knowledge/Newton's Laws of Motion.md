# Newton's Laws of Motion
Isaac Newton defined three laws that defined the motion of objects in the majority of cases in the universe, where [[special relativity]] is not required.

## Newton's First Law of Motion
An object will remain in its current state of motion or rest until an unbalanced [[Force]] acts upon it.

## Newton's Second Law of Motion
$$F=ma$$
where
- $F$ is the force on an object, in Newtons
- $m$ is the mass of the object, in kilograms
- $a$ is the acceleration of the object, in $\textnormal{ms}^{-2}$

## Newton's Third Law of Motion
For every force, there exists another [[Force]] exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
